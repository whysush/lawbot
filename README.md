# Attempting to fine-tune an LLM Model to answer legal doubts
As the title suggests, this is an attempt to fine-tune a Gemini GenAI Model (base model: Gemini 1.5 Flash 001 Tuning) to help answer legal doubts.

The dataset used is formatted as a list of legal QnA, which the model then uses to answer user questions.

**Note**: This model is not being trained or used as a substitute to actual lawyers. Please rely on professional legal assistance always. The model's responses are to be taken with a grain of salt as it is run on a comparatively small dataset. Dataset based on the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India.
