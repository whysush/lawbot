# Attempting to fine-tune an LLM Model to answer legal doubts
As the title suggests, this is an attempt to fine-tune a Gemini GenAI Model (base model: ```Gemini 1.5 Flash 001 Tuning```) to help answer legal doubts.

**Note**: This model is not being trained or used as a substitute to actual lawyers. Please rely on professional legal assistance always. The model's responses are to be taken with a grain of salt as it is run on a comparatively small dataset. Dataset based on the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India.

Note: Unable to export model as a .h5 or .keras file at the moment.

## Dataset
The dataset ```1.csv``` is a dataset formatted as a list of legal QnA that cites the Constitution of India, the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, India.
